1> Airflow is open source plateform to programatically develop schedule and orchestrate worflows.
2> We can easily write python file to describe task to run ans airflow will ensure execution 
workflows are bind as code so they can be more maintainable vesionable , testable and colaborative
it also ensure each task interact correctely to each other

give eampple of one flow -- download

Why choose airflow

Extensibility: it can possible to create any task with code with our custom code
RElability: Airflow ensure that Any task execute correctly also notify stake holder correctly
Scalable : execution task can scale to any level




Operator: only python know how to download the invoice--- How Airflow know it-- The way the encode the information via operators

operator are python object represent tasks and execute verity of function

Airflow has pre made operator to perform lots of operation

our jon intantiate that operator and plugin into Dag object

Our main task:
    Create DAG-- Actual pipeline
	Operator is representation of task
	inside task Task : Actual instruction need to perform
	add some order based on dependencies
